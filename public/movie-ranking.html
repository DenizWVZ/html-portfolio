<h1>The best movies according to me<h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Spirited away</h3>
<p>Fell in love with it as a kid after my mom bought me a VHS copy of it. Great story and so beatuiful.</p>

<h3>The Devil Wears Prada</h3>
<p>I love how this movie depicts the business of working in a city. While some things might have aged poorly, I still think it's a pretty great and lighthearted movie</p>

<h3>Gone Girl</h3>
<p>I love thrillers, and this movie had me jaw dropped in the theater. I've only watched it once, but I feel like rewatching it will never give me the same exeperience. Crazy plot tiwst, great cinematogrpahy and acting as well.</p>
